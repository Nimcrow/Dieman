My first attempt at making a game!


So I started this projet with a big vision. Unfortunately I couldn't really achieve it as I wanted to be.
I tried to do a fully 2D project when I started, but animating the moves felt impossible in 2D. so I quickly switched to 3D.

I ended up following along with this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcF66q-UPCs
It changed the animations and that took ages to do. I used Meshy to come up with the 3D models. And Mixamo to animate them as I went along.
Now this vision is no where near what I wanted to do initially, and I am really disapointed in myself that I couldn't make progress in this project so far.

I still need to do the following in order to have a semi-working game as far as the tutorial goes:
1- Implementing Enemy knockdown animations and player combos.
2- Adding Sound effects to attacks and background music.
3- Making the camera dynamic to follow the player through the map.
4- Having the enemy do damage to the player.
5- And implementing UI.

For my own vision I have a ton to work on. And although it's still very overwhelming I will try to do the following in the coming steps:
1- Add different enemy variations and enemy bosses.
2- Try to improve on the way that the game looks and feels.
3- Adding levels and objectives
4- Adding a narrative to the game
5- Adding a stamina mechanic to the game.

I will keep working on this till I get it right.

And Thank you so much for your time and feedback +)
